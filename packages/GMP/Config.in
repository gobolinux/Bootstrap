	---help---
	  GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, 
	  operating on signed integers, rational numbers, and floating
	  point numbers. There is no practical limit to the precision
	  except the ones implied by the available memory in the machine
	  GMP runs on. GMP has a rich set of functions, and the functions 
	  have a regular interface.
	  
	  Say Y if you want to include that, or if you want to compile
	  the GCC suite of compilers.
