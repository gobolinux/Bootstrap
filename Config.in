	  Removes headers, static libs, libtool, pkgconfig, locales and M4
	  data. Also removes documentation, strips all libraries and
	  executables found on each package, and performs an additional
	  cleanup based on per-package scripts found in the subdirectories
	  inside 'packages/'.
	  
	  Please note that this action isn't taken automatically. In order
	  to effectivelly shrink the filesystem, you must type 'make shrink'
	  in the command line, which will still make a backup of the generated
	  filesystem prior to removing its contents.

config SHRINK_HEADERS
	bool "Remove headers"
	---help---
	  Removes headers found on each package, needed only at compile time. To
	  perform the removal, you still must type 'make shrink' in the command
	  line, which will make a backup of the generated filesystem prior to
	  removing its contents.
    
config SHRINK_STATIC_LIBS
	bool "Remove static libraries"
	---help---
	  Removes static libs found on each package, needed only at compile time
	  by some programs. To perform the removal, you still must type 'make shrink'
	  in the command line, which will make a backup of the generated filesystem
	  prior to removing its contents.
    
config SHRINK_LIBTOOL
	bool "Remove libtool related files"
	---help---
	  Removes libtool files found on each package, used at compile time by
	  some programs. To perform the removal, you still must type 'make shrink'
	  in the command line, which will make a backup of the generated filesystem
	  prior to removing its contents.
    
config SHRINK_PKGCONFIG
	bool "Remove pkgconfig related files"
	---help---
	  Removes pkgconfig files found on each package, used at compile time by
	  some programs. To perform the removal, you still must type 'make shrink'
	  in the command line, which will make a backup of the generated filesystem
	  prior to removing its contents.
    
config SHRINK_DOCS

	---help---
	  Removes documentation (man, info, docs) found on each package. To perform
	  the removal, you still must type 'make shrink' in the command line, which
	  will make a backup of the generated filesystem prior to removing its
	  contents.
    
config SHRINK_DEFAULT_SETTINGS

	---help---
	  Removes backup of the default settings for each package. Please note that
	  this is not recommended, as these files usually take only a few bytes and
	  are very helpful on recovering from problems on settings files. To perform
	  the removal, you still must type 'make shrink' in the command line, which
	  will make a backup of the generated filesystem prior to removing its
	  contents.

config SHRINK_STRIP_ALL
	bool "All symbols from executables and libraries"
	---help---
	  Removes all symbols which aren't strictly necessary to get the program
	  running. This will make it impossible to use the libraries for linkage,
	  and will also remove relocation information on them. To perform the
	  removal, you still must type 'make shrink' in the command line, which
	  will make a backup of the generated filesystem prior to removing its
	  contents.

config SHRINK_STRIP_UNNEEDED
	bool "All symbols not needed by relocations"
	---help---
	  Removes symbols from files, keeping only symbols used by relocations.
	  To perform the removal, you still must type 'make shrink' in the
