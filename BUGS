# odd environment problems:
- When running on GoboLinux, you must 'unalias make', since ColorMake can break
compilation of packages which offer a graphical frontend based on dialog. These
programs include uClibc, Busybox and the Linux kernel, among others.

# probably fixed:
- conflicts on Scripts and TinyScripts binaries at Symlink time
- ldconfig: Can't open configuration file /System/ARM/Programs/Glibc/Settings/ld.so.conf:
            No such file or directory


# still open / needs more attention:
- compiling glibc the first time doesn't work -- seems to be a problem with chrootcompile;
- populate /Files/Fonts
- ln -s /Files/Fonts /System/ARM/Programs/Xorg/7.0/lib/X11/fonts
- add to Glibc recipe: pre_link() { mkdir -p $target/../Settings }
- add to Pango recipe: pre_link() { mkdir -p $target/../Settings }
- 'Compile rxvt' doesn't install librxvt.so.1
- 'Compile XFCE' -> where are the settings going to?
- Pango: pango-querymodules bug
- make_options=(LD_LIBRARY_PATH=)
