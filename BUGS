# odd environment problems:
- When running on GoboLinux, you must 'unalias make', since ColorMake can break
  compilation of packages which offer a graphical frontend based on dialog. These
  programs include uClibc, Busybox and the Linux kernel, among others.
- Local cross files are not taken into account by ChrootCompile, which has its
  own copy of them, taken from the CVS. Need to figure out a clean way to handle
  this.

# still open / needs more attention:
- populate /Files/Fonts
- ln -s /Files/Fonts /System/ARM/Programs/Xorg/7.0/lib/X11/fonts
- 'Compile RXVT' doesn't install librxvt.so.1
