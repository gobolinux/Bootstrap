# cross-compiling dependencies
- Files needed in the host platform to cross-compile the Xorg misc fonts
  (http://xorg.freedesktop.org/releases/X11R7.0/src/font):
  /Programs/Xorg-Font-Util/7.0/bin/ucs2any
  /Programs/Xorg/7.0/bin/bdftopcf
  /Programs/Xorg/7.0/bin/mkfontscale
  /Programs/Xorg/7.0/bin/mkfontdir
- Files needed in the host platform to cross-compile Glib:
  /Programs/GLib/2.8.1/bin/glib-genmarshal
- Needed to compile GQmpeg (and probably others):
  /Programs/GTK+/2.6.0/bin/gdk-pixbuf-csource

# still open / needs more attention:
- populate /Files/Fonts
- ln -s /Files/Fonts /System/ARM/Programs/Xorg/7.0/lib/X11/fonts
- 'Compile RXVT' doesn't install librxvt.so.1
- Fontconfig and its fonts/fonts.conf which needs to be adjusted to /Files/Fonts
- Find a clean way to call /System/Links/Tasks/EnvironmentCheck at the 1st boot

- startx:
