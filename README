This is Bootstrap, from the GoboLinux from Scratch project.

It's aimed to generate a new distribution based on the
GoboLinux hierarchy, focused on embedded systems.
Bootstrap handles cross-compiling very well, and has
already been used to make successful ARM and SH-4 ports.

In order to use it, it's necessary to have a GoboLinux
host system, since it relies on its Compile and Scripts
tools. Just ensure that you have the latest versions installed,
since Bootstrap relies on many bleeding edge features
from these tools.

If you are cross-compiling, make sure to have a valid
Cross-$ARCH.conf file, and a functional toolchain installed
on your host computer. Please refer to the Knowledge Base[1]
and to the Cross-ARM.conf and Cross-SH4.conf examples for 
further explanations about cross compiling scripts and
their mandatory entries.

Bootstrap usage is then pretty simple. Just type ./Bootstrap
to select which packages you want to have on your target system,
among other questions such as your super-user's name and selecting
your target's architecture. Finished with that, the script will
automatically call 'make', which will generate the GoboLinux
tree inside the chosen prefix and will spawn Compile for each 
package you selected previously.

Full documentation to this tool can be found at [2].

Please make suggestions and bug reports directly in the
GoboLinux development mailing list[3], and just let us know
of your experiences with it.

Have a good hacking!
