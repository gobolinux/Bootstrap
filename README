This is Bootstrap, from the GoboLinux from Scratch project.

It's aimed to generate a new distribution based on the
GoboLinux hierarchy, focused towards embedded usage.
Bootstrap handles cross-compiling very fine, and has
already been used to make successful ARM and SH-4 ports.

In order to use it, it's necessary to have a GoboLinux
host system, since it relies on its Compile and Scripts
tools. Just ensure to have their latest versions installed,
since Bootstrap relies on many bleeding edge features
from these tools.

If you are cross-compiling, make sure to have a valid
Cross-$ARCH.conf file, and a functional toolchain installed
on your host computer. Please refer to the Knowledge Base[1]
for further explanations about cross compiling scripts and
their mandatory entries.

Bootstrap usage is then pretty simple. Just issue
'make menuconfig' to select which packages you want to have
on your target system, among other questions such as your 
super-user's name and selecting your target's architecture.
Finished with that, run 'make deps'. This command will check
dependencies for each chosen program, and will add them into
the list of packages that Bootstrap needs to compile, too.
Finally, 'make' will perform the generation of the GoboLinux
tree inside the chosen prefix and will spawn Compile for
each of these packages.

Please make suggestions and bug reports directly in the
GoboLinux development mailing list[2], and just let us know
of your experiences with it.

Have a good hacking!
